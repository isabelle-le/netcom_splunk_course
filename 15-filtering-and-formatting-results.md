## Filtering and Formatting

### The `eval` command
* calculates an expression and puts the resulting value into a search results field.
If the field name that you specify does not match a field in the output, a new field is added to the search results.
 If the field name that you specify matches a field name that already exists in the search results, the results of the eval expression overwrite the values in that field. 

The `eval` command evaluates mathematical, string, and boolean expressions.

You can chain multiple eval expressions in one search using a comma to separate subsequent expressions.
