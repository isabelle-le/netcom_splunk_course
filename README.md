##### Notes:
-----
* What are they expecting:
*   team background ETL Development mostly done on SQL
*   loading batch files from clients to Data warehouse
*   currently using splunk ( FTP logs, system event logs ) -> Other potentials ( logins -> whose logged in but not badged in? )
*   Gain more expertise with the tool ( Alerting and Responding ) -> Cron jobs examples for running and reacting to events
*   Alerting and Monitoring Production Events
*   Dedicated Splunk team ( works for experian; global dashboards for executive reporting, wants the same skills )
*   Generic Queries to look at logs, but mostly wants altering and monitoring products
*   DevOps ( Enterprise  ); SSiS ( logs ); 
*   Already a processes under to load things into splunk
*   Wants to really be able to break down, and respond to the data.
*   Digital Books  ( ensure private hosting of materials; `zip` )
